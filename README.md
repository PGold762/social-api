# Social API

## Description

I want to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

### User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation

Download the files from the repo and be sure to install the following:

- MongoDB
- Express
- Mongoose

Once installed, start your server and test in Insomnia.

## Usage

This is an app local on your device that you may trigger within terminal and see the functionality in Insomnia
